# Churchill-App
An Android (and maybe later iOS) app for Sir Winston Churchill High School in Calgary.

I have recently discovered a grave problem: Western Canada High School has an app, whereas Churchill does not. This must clearly be rectified as quickly as possible.

The [WCHS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/western-canada-high-school/id532207802?mt=8) has, according to [this page](http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b816/pages/app/wchs-app.html), the following features:

* Staff Contact information
* Commonly used tools such as D2L and HomeLOGIC
* News feed from school homepage
* Western World - Student Publication
* Registration Guide
* Student Handbook
* Daily Bulletin
* School Council Info
* Athletics and Fine Arts webpages
* Allow us to push important updates out to the community.
* Feedback Form / Feature Request

Similar features will be implemented in the Churchill app.

Current features:
* none
